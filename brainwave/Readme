# Mini Drone for Cattle Farming

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a mini drone tailored for cattle farming applications. The drone is designed to assist farmers in monitoring and managing their cattle more efficiently through aerial surveillance and data collection.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Observe cattle movement and behavior in real-time.
- **Automated Health Checks**: Use integrated sensors to perform health and wellness checks on the cattle.
- **GPS Tracking**: Locate lost or stray cattle using GPS-enabled tracking.
- **Data Analysis**: Collect and analyze data to improve pasture management and resource allocation.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware and Firmware**: Drone components and firmware for flight control.
- **GPS and Sensors**: Integration of GPS and various sensors for tracking and monitoring.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms for behavior analysis and anomaly detection.
- **IoT**: Real-time data transmission and monitoring using IoT technologies.
